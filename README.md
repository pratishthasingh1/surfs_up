# Overview
An analysis was done to determine the viability of a surf shop. A data analyst performed summary statistics on temperatures stored in a SQLite database during the month of June and December to investigate if a surf shop/ice cream shop would be a good idea.

# Results
From the above screenshots of the June statistics and December statistics, it can be said that:

![dec](https://github.com/pratishthasingh1/surfs_up/blob/master/december.png)
* Weather stays pretty stable in Oahu (mean during June: 75degrees, during December: 71degrees). 
* Ice cream shop may otherwise be a silly idea if it weren't in a place where the temperature generally never drops below 55 degrees. In Oahu, the temperature doesn't get lower than 56 degrees during either of those months. 
* There are less temperature entries in December than June, possibly due to less daylight hours during the day?
# Summary
I would run a query to determine hours in daylight during those months to determine the operational hours that would be best for those months.
I would run a query to determine average amounts of days it rains during those months to make sure a surf shop makes sense.
